# Project: "Quit Your Wine-ing: Predicting Wine Quality"

## Project Goal and Description
The goal of this project is to predict the quality of wine while incorporating unsupervised learning techniques. We aim to identify key drivers of wine quality for the California Wine Institute and provide insights to the data science team responsible for data-driven consultation in the winery supply chain marketing.

## Data Dictionary
Below is a data dictionary that provides an overview of the dataset's features and their descriptions:

- `fixed_acidity`: The fixed acidity of the wine.
- `volatile_acidity`: The volatile acidity of the wine.
- `citric_acid`: The citric acid content in the wine.
- `residual_sugar`: The residual sugar content in the wine.
- `chlorides`: The chloride content in the wine.
- `free_sulfur_dioxide`: The amount of free sulfur dioxide in the wine.
- `total_sulfur_dioxide`: The total sulfur dioxide content in the wine.
- `density`: The density of the wine.
- `pH`: The pH level of the wine.
- `sulphates`: The amount of sulphates in the wine.
- `alcohol`: The alcohol content in the wine.
- `quality`: The quality rating of the wine (target variable).
- `wine_type`: The type of wine (e.g., red or white).

## Project Plan
1. Data Collection: Gathered the dataset containing wine-related features and quality ratings.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the dataset's characteristics and relationships between features.
4. Unsupervised Learning - Clustering: Applied clustering algorithms to identify groups of similar wines.
5. Feature Engineering: Utilized clustering results and engineered features for machine learning.
6. Machine Learning Model: Developed a predictive model to estimate wine quality.
7. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
8. Conclusion and Insights: Summarized findings and insights from the analysis.

initial_questions = """
## Initial Questions
- What are the key features that influence wine quality?
- How do unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering, impact the prediction of wine quality?
- Are there distinct groups or clusters of wines based on their characteristics?
"""

conclusion = """
## Conclusion
This project successfully explored and predicted wine quality using a combination of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, unsupervised learning (clustering), feature engineering, and machine learning. The results provide valuable insights into the factors affecting wine quality and demonstrate the potential of clustering techniques in understanding wine characteristics.
